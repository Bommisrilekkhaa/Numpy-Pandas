colab--virtual environment , run in live server

tpu --> tensor processing (matrix -- 2D)(vector (Magnitude ,direction) --1D)(availibilty will not always present as trafic will be there in colab)

gpu --> vector processing(pixel)-->more core

cpu --> less core more time in multithreading/paralellism

Difference b/w numpy and pandas

array format and table format
numpy --> can access using only index
pandas --> can access using row and columns
Pandas --> software library data analysis large set of data can be preprocessed diff b/w dataframe and database --> functionality and operations

sql --> fast than pandas

quantitative --> level like Manager ,HR -->numerical data

qualitative --> non numerical

Polars --> used in Big Data --> large set of data

Pyspark --> data processing ->more than 2gb

--- running bys.... (library -> base function) ---

numpy -> c,c++

python -> c

pandas -> numpy

roboflow website ----> data annotation/segmentation site

--- Stages in ML ---

dataset stage:

collect
organise
label
preprocess
model stage:

train
model build
deploy stage:

test
deploy
Pandas

series --> 1D

DataFrame -- 2D --> rows and columns
