colab--virtual environment , run in live server

tpu --> tensor processing (matrix -- 2D)(vector (Magnitude ,direction) --1D)(availibilty will not always present as trafic will be there in colab)

gpu --> vector processing(pixel)-->more core

cpu --> less core more time in multithreading/paralellism

# Difference b/w numpy and pandas:

array format and table format
numpy --> can access using only index
pandas --> can access using row and columns
Pandas --> software library data analysis large set of data can be preprocessed diff b/w dataframe and database --> functionality and operations

sql --> fast than pandas

quantitative --> level like Manager ,HR -->numerical data

qualitative --> non numerical

Polars --> used in Big Data --> large set of data

Pyspark --> data processing ->more than 2gb

--- running bys.... (library -> base function) ---

numpy -> c,c++

python -> c

pandas -> numpy

roboflow website ----> data annotation/segmentation site

# --- Stages in ML ---

# dataset stage:

1. collect

2. organise
  
3. label
   
4. preprocess
   
# model stage:

1. train
   
2. model build
   
# deploy stage:

1. test
   
2. deploy
   
## Pandas:

series --> 1D

DataFrame -- 2D --> rows and columns
